# Hardware Beginner


For the Hardware part of the [EDP IoT Hackathon](http://edpiothackathon.edp.pt/), 
teams will be challenged to connect an Arduino-like board to one 
[EDP Energy Box (EB)](https://www.edpdistribuicao.pt/pt/rede/InovGrid/Pages/aEdpBox.aspx), 
EDP's latest smart meter device that is currently being deployed across Portugal. 

All EBs are [certified energy meter devices](https://www.edpdistribuicao.pt/pt/rede/InovGrid/EDP%20Documents/SGS0043.pdf) by the *EC Directive 2004/22/EC* european norm 
and each participating team will have full access to them at the [EDP Starter HQ](https://www.edpstarter.com/).

Before start hacking, it's crucial to get to know the basics about Arduino & Arduino IDE and the board all teams will use.
