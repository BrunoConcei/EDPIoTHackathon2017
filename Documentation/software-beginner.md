# Software Beginner

This guide will help you ramp up with the software part needed for the [EDP IoT Hackathon](http://edpiothackathon.edp.pt).

The challenge presented to you in this hackathon, requires assembling a cloud-based (Windows Azure) solution to collect all the readings from the EDP Box. This process of sending data to the Azure Platform is called data ingestion, and there are some available services that will help you achieve your goals.

But before that, let's dive into the Microsoft cloud platform called [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com).
